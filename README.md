In this i have performed five different features like Scater Plot , Box plot, Histogram plot and bar plot among all this visualizations bar plot and Histogram plot is very easy to unterstand the plots and read the data. When it comes to the syntax scater plot is very easy.
 
 overall, bar charts analysis makes me very easier when compared to the other techniques.
