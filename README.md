 Line charts are useful for tracking changes over time and identifying trends. They can make it easier to see patterns and fluctuations in data that might be missed in a table or spreadsheet Bar charts are useful for comparing values between different categories. They can make it easier to see which categories have the highest or lowest values and identify any outliers. Pie charts are useful for showing proportions or percentages. They can make it easier to see how much of a total value each category or segment represents. Scatter plots are useful for examining the relationship between two variables. They can make it easier to see if there is a correlation between the variables and identify any outliers or patterns in the data. Heat maps are useful for showing the distribution of values across two or more dimensions. 
 
 overall, line charts analysis makes me very easier when compared to the other techniques.
